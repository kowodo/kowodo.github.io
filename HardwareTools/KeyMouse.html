    <h1>DRAFT VERSION 1</h1>
    ================================================================
    <h1>Keymouse Alpha:<br>
        All the information I wish I had but it still probably would not deter me from buying it.</h1>

    <p>
        This article intends to provide information I would be interested in before purchasing the device.
    </p>
    <h1>TLDR aka Summary</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            KeyMouse Alpha is device combining functionality of a keyboard and a mouse.
            The main promise is to allow users to operate the mouse without moving hands of out typing position.
            In theory you should be faster and more comfortable while working.
            You can see their
            <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1666150716/keymousetm-the-keyboard-and-mouse-re-invented">Kick starter page </a>
            or
            <a href="https://www.keymouse.com/">KeyMouse homepage </a> where the promises are summarized.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have used daily the KeyMouse for roughly two years now. My personal experience and conclusions are as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiple hardware parts like key switches or scroll wheels of Keymouse Alpha breaks and it needs constant maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Usage of Keymouse Alpha led in my case to various RSI - like symptoms like palm, arm or shoulder pain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reprogramming of the keyboard is great, but on this device it has some limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keymouse Alpha may be used in wireless mode only with great difficulties. Wireless mode is simply not worth all the troubles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The device is insanely expensive. The only reason you would buy it is there is not another device on the market which fulfils the Keymouse main promise.
            I love to keep my hands on home row and being able to move mouse pointer. As of now I have doubts if that is such a great advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The thumb keys on Keymouse Alpha are the best thing ever since the sliced bread.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keymouse Alpha is a great concept of a input device. If taken as such it's great.
            If considered as workhorse. I'm would bevery disappointed as every cheap peripheral for few dollars
            has longer life span without a need to repair and superior wireless capability when compared to
            the insanely expensive Keymouse Alpha.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the main problem I have with this device is the discomfort and pain it caused to me. The better option
            might be it's bigger brother "KeyMouse Track" which is using trackballs instead of 'mouse' movement to move mouse pointer.
            Or build your own with better capabilities and price.

    <h1>Details</h1>

    <p>
        I have ordered The KeyMouse Alpha at the beginning of June in 2018. Think I have received it in the same month and use it
        on daily basis ever since. That's roughly two years of usage.
        With that experience I have something to say about it.
    </p>
    <p>
        KeyMouse Alpha delivers on it's promise of keeping your hand at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">keyboard home row</a>.
    </p>

    <div>
        <h3>Is it good?</h3>
        <p>Awesomely YES and Hell NO!</p>
        <p>Right now it is the only device available on the market which
            lets you operate Keyboard and Mouse at the same time without moving your hand away from home row. And I LOVE IT!
            On the other hand: It is freaking expensive and have a LOT OF ISSUES.</p>
        <p>Lets start with the issues first.</p>

    </div>
    <h2>Complaining part</h2>
    <div>
        <h3>The main issues</h3>
        <p>
            Issues and shortcomings I have experienced first hand using KeyMouse Alpha are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Breaking mouse buttons.</li>
            <li>Breaking scroll wheels.</li>
            <li>Smelly Rubber coating.</li>
            <li>Rubber coating wearing off.</li>
            <li>Palm pain/ strain.</li>
            <li>Forearm pain</li>
            <li>Shoulder pain</li>
            <li>Quick wear off of key caps.</li>
            <li>Reprogrammability limitations.</li>
            <li>Non-functioning keyboard shortcuts.</li>
            <li>Impossible key sequences / combinations.</li>
            <li>Disconnecting in wireless mode.</li>
            <li>Great lag / delay on mouse movement in wireless mode.</li>
            <li>Device unresponsiveness after leaving it for a while.</li>
            <li>"Wild" cursor.</li>
        </ul>

        <div>
            <h4>Mouse Buttons</h4>
            <p>They die. It's simple a that. They are hard to press first - keypresses does not registered or they double click on single press.
                That is followed by total malfunction soon after. Defectivity rate positively correlates with the frequency of usage. In my case left mouse button, mouse freeze and F2
                keys, which I use often, had to be replaced on multiple occasions. I lost track on how many times I did so.</p>

            <p>It is worth noting I'm not the only one experiencing the same. Multiple people complained about the mouse buttons.
                An example can be seen here: <a href="https://www.keymouse.com/forum/small-buttons-problem">KeyMouse forum: Small buttons problem</a>.
                The KeyMouse company is trying to fix it. As far as I am aware, they changed the switches two times.
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x1x089z4yI">The last update video</a> (Dec. 2019) mentions the last iteration on them.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Palm pain</h4>
            <p>I suspect the small mouse switches of being the main cause of my palm pain I had while using the KeyMouse.
                The main reason being my right palm pain was "cured" once I proceed to click with
                my left hand only as the left half had working switches at the time.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Scroll-Wheels</h4>
            <p> died on me twice so far, one on each side.
                Long story short: They send scrolling signals in the opposite direction also.
                Your screen jumps and you scroll nowhere.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Rubber coating:</h4>
            <p>
                It smells and it wears off.
            </p>
            <p> The top housing of the Keymouse Alpha is made from white plastic (unless asked them to do it otherwise)
                which is covered with rubbery layer. I'm not sure if it is made the same way since the latest version showed in
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x1x089z4yI">The last update video</a> looks different. There is no way of knowing as KeyMouse company
                does not disclose updates.</p>
            <p>Here I feel obliged to mention those two: One- I'm very sensitive to smells. Two- I do come in touch with various devices with rubber coatings like
                laptops, headphones or gamepads on daily basis and have no issue with those whatsoever.
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples of people having problems with that coating could be also found on Keymouse forum.
                <a href="https://www.keymouse.com/forum/keymouse-stress">Here is one</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Eventually I have ordered black KeyMouse Alpha shells without the rubber coating.
                The rubber coating is there for a reason. Which brings us to the next topic.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Friction:</h4>
            <p> Maybe I should say "Two frictions".</p>
            <p>First is the friction between the mouse and mouse pad.
                I will call it here "mouse feet friction". The less of mouse pad friction the less force you need to move your device.
            </p>
            <p>The second one I did not notice until having KeyMouse Alpha. It is friction between your hand and mouse.
                I will call it here "hand friction".
            </p>
            <p>
                Why is it important? Let me explain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Compared to any mouse I ever used it is much harder to move KeyMouse Alpha. Now I'm comparing the force required to move it when pushing from side without any weight resting on it.
                Even big mice like Razer Naga are much easier to move around.
            </p>
            <p>Keymouse Alpha is moved by arms while palms are resting on the devices. To be exact: One moves forearm if elbows are resting on table.
                One moves whole arm with the device if they are not.
                The more of arm weight is resting on the device, the greater the mouse feet friction is and the harder it is to move it.
                Without the smelly rubber coating and with the need of increased force to move KeyMouse Alpha I got to learn a thing about my self:
                Sometimes, especially (but not only) in winter my hands are dry or at least dryer.
                When they are it is noticeably harder to move KeyMouse Alpha without my hands slipping from it.
                That can be solved by applying Nivea lotion on my hands.
            </p>
            <p>Finding the way to reduce the mouse pad friction I have tried multiple Mouse pads. The hard top mouse pads turned out to have the least friction from them all.
                I also have installed
                <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/stick-these-ceramic-feet-on-any-gaming-mouse-for-an-instant-upgrade/">3rd party special ceramic mouse feet</a>. Those are now
                standard to every newer version of Keymouse Alpha.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Forearm pain</h4>
            <p>Now I'm not exacly sure how I got rid of that one. Think the remedy was combination of decreased friction, frequent stretching and few visits of masseur.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Shoulder pain</h4>
            <p>I was using Keymouse Alpha without my elbows resting on any surface for many months. I'm guessing 7.
                During the Corona isolation times I have developed serious pain in my right shoulder.
                Magic, friction reducing, combination of hardtop mouse pad and ceramic mouse feet did not help.
                Disabling the right mouse and moving mouse cursor with my left hand only provided the sweet relief. But I'm not fond of moving entire keyboard
                when I want to move mouse cursor.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>A note on all the pain and discomfort</h4>
            <b>After listing all the pains I have had. I feel like a hypochondriac here and have urge to say following:
                I did not had any pain or discomforts caused by using keyboard or mouse before switching to KeyMouse Alpha.</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Keycaps</h4>
            <p>
                are custom made for KeyMouse. KeyMouse have keys closer together than your "normal" keyboard and standard keys not fit on Keyboard unless modified.
                They are made of some white plastic which is painted black. On black paint might be printed legends ( there's an option without them ). On the top of Keyswitch is a
                clear coat of something. The top layer peals/ wear off very quickly.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Programability</h4>
            <p>It is awesome in general. But: Macros are NOT stored on the device. They are stored in the KeyMouse software installed on your computer.</p>
            <a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/one_shot_keys">One shot layers</a> or <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_tap_dance"> tap dance </a>
            features are missing.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Keyboard shortcuts</h4>
            <p>Not all of them work. An example in Windows is Windows key + number. That let's you switch really quickly between
                applications. For more than one window of application open mentioned shortcut does not work.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Impossible Keysequences</h4>
            <p>One example: Holding blue layer and pressing D key and F key send only what is on blue layer under the D key.
                The workaround is to press blue layer, press D, release D, then press F.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Keyboard disconnects in wireless mode</h4>
            <p>Even when device is connected with cable and the battery
                is in KeyMouse Alpha it stop responding. Workaround is to flip the devices, turn them off and on again.</p>
            <h4>Serious lag when in wireless mode</h4>
            <p>This happens from time to time at random intervals.</p>
            <h4>Cursor goes wild in wireless mode</h4>
            <p>After some random time of inactivity. Cursor picks direction at random
                and just runs. A Restart of the device is needed.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>A note on wireless mode</h4>
            <p>It is unusable for me. The situation is better when connected via cable and it is best when you remove
                batteries from the devices as some of the wireless problems persist if you do not do so.</p>
        </div>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>The price</h3>
        <p>My version on KeyMouse Alpha did cost me $500. But I had to buy new switches, new scroll wheels.
            Based on my experience I do expect them to break eventually. So I bought much more replacement parts.
            As of now (June of 2020) it looks like Keymouse Alpha is discontinued.
            Expected price as of 2020 May 31 for the new KeyMouse Track version is $699 and $725 respectively.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Ergonomics</h3>
        <p>
            Yes there is more on this topic. :)
        </p>
        <p>Because you are using your hands to move the keyboard too, your palms are virtually glued to the device.</p>

        <p>Keys like P and Q on a normal keyboard are typed by moving your entire hand forwards to reach them with your pinkies.
            There is a bump enclosing scroll wheel in the way on Keymouse and you lose your 'moving the mouse' position doing so.</p>

        <p>Better way si pressing Q and P with your ring fingers.
            Somewhere is video from KeyMouse company recommending doing just that.
            I was not able to find it while writing this.</p>

        <p>Coming across that sooner would save me some money, effort and frustration.
            As I was not able to reach Q and P keys comfortably I tried to solve this by
            ordering the 3D printed shells one size smaller.
            The size was fine and I just needed to change the typing technique.</p>
        <p>
            The Windows keys in their original position are uncomfortable to reach with palms in typing position.
        </p>
        <p>
            The thumb keys are awesome. Especially if you use shortcuts so much as I do, you will love them.
            After working on keyboard with 4 buttons for each thumb, one gigantic key for two thumbs does not make sense
            to me and feels like total waste of two strongest fingers.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>The learning curve</h3>
        <p> Oh boy was I in for a ride. Type anything in reasonable fashion took me way longer than stated learning time on KeyMouse website.
            At a time I thought I am a complete Imbecile for spending so much money on this device
            as I was not able to type the things I wanted.
            It is possible learn it eventually. I did get used to it and it is a second nature to me now.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Keymouse Company communication</h3>
        <h4>There is no public roadmap / backlog </h4>
        There is no roadmap. No public information about progress on anything.
        Users asked about it. Keymouse answer is something like "why would you needed that information"

        <h4>Answers on Keymouse forum</h4>
        lots of them from the company are "Your request/ issue was added to our backlog". As the backlog is not disclosed, so you have no idea if your case
        will be addressed this week, in 5 years on 1000 years from now. Since it is not known it is a non-answer.

        <h4>Unfulfilled promises</h4>
        Unreleased Keymouse Comet comes to mind. They announced release of that device <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu7-x-fuONY">"probably in next week"</a> It never happened.
        No new information on that topic was released. Another case what comes to mind is the <a href="https://www.keymouse.com/forum/keymouse-case">Keymouse case</a>. As it also was never
        realized without explanation those feel like unfulfilled promises. Think it is understandable something could go wrong. Without that information it just feels like unfulfilled promises.
        And does not inspire confidence in next announcements.
    </div>

    <h2>Praising part</h2>
    <div>
        <h3>Keymouse Company communication</h3>
        <p>I know I just bashed them on the same topic. But nothing is back and white isn't it?</p>
        <h4>Quick responses</h4>
        It might happen on forum and in mail. Sometimes you can get the response the same day.
        <h4>Friendly problem solving</h4>
        In general I get the feeling they are trying to help and solve the problems users are facing.
        One story for all: When I was replacing my KeyMouse shells for ones without the smelly rubber,
        they offered to cover the costs as another users had similar problem. At the time I wanted to
        get the shells one size smaller, so we did split the cost. I was paying only for parts which had
        to be printed on top of that because I wanted smaller shell size.

    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Programability</h3>
        Besides the shortcomings I mentioned above it is wonderful feature. It allows you to do so much!
        I wish every keyboard I will use from now on will be reprogrammable.
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Ergonomics</h3>
        <p>Looks like I will deny everything I said doesn't it? </p>
        <h4>Thumb keys</h4>
        I have already touched on that. They are great no matter how they are programmed.
        This is another feature which I consider as non-negotiable feature of keyboard.
        Right now I feel like 4 well placed thumb keys per thumb are absolute minimum keyboard should have.
